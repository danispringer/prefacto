INTRO

• Primes Fun lets you work with prime numbers in 4 different ways: Checker, List, Factorize, and Randomize.


SOME TIPS

 • In addition to using the Randomize page of the app, you can use Siri to get random primes. To do so: open Settings > Siri & Search > All Shortcuts > Get random prime, then record the phrase you want to tell Siri whenever you want Siri to get you a random prime.
Note: In order to set up Siri Shortcuts, your device needs to be running iOS 12 or later, and in order to see the 'Get random prime' shortcut available, you must first have generated at least 1 random prime in the app itself, using the 'Randomize' button.

• If a page is calculating, switching to a different page will not interrupt that.

• You can tap on the top right button to share or save a result.

• You can turn the app's sounds on or off in the app's settings. With the app's sound set to 'On', sounds play when you find a prime number, or if you accidentally enter invalid text in a textfield.

• You can set the app's theme to dark or light in the app's settings.


CHECKER

• Check whether any number is prime, and if it is not, see a number it is divisible by.

• Type or paste a number, then tap on 'Check'.

• Find a prime number to hear a satisfying 'Choo'!


LIST

• List with all the prime numbers in a given range: for example, type 1 in the first text box, 10 in the second, tap on List, and you will get 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7.


FACTOR

• Get the prime factors for a number: for example, type 12, and you will get 2, 3, and 3.


RANDOM

• Get a random prime of a size of your choice.
• This can be done using Siri Shortcuts as well (see 'Some Tips' above for instructions).
• You can also get a weekly HUGE prime right delivered right to you as a notification. Long press on the notification for a handy 'Copy' button.

- Add option for light/dark mode
- hide jump to top and bottom buttons if all cells are visible (or if 'no primes in range')
- zoomable image
- hide keyboard without animation (disrupts loading or other stuff?)
- persistence: sound on/off, last used view(?)
- OCR: Do images have their number in their Flickr description? How hard is it to find a number in an image? (OCR)
- [? - Must have stop button] add primes orderly generator (maybe with starting point).

- UICollectionView delegates could be put in a separate extension

###### App Store Description
Primes Fun lets you:
• Check whether any* number is prime
• List the prime numbers in any* given range
• Factorize to primes any* given number
• Generate random** prime numbers
• View fun images with prime numbers in them
• Share your results, like that huge prime number you found, which everyone must know about

\*A 64 bit device, like the one in your hand, can calculate up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (or 2^63 − 1)
\*\*Random primes will be generated up to 4,000,000,000 (and some more)

Did you know? When running big calculations, you can navigate in between the app's different pages while they are loading, and come back to them later. Your initiated tasks won't be interrupted.

Get Primes Fun today, and discover the fun!

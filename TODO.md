###### App Store Description
• Check whether a number is prime
• List the prime numbers in a range
• Factorize a number
• Generate random primes of a size of your choosing
• Share or save your results
• And more


INTRO

• Primes Fun lets you work with prime numbers in 5 different ways: Checker, List, Factorize, Randomize, and Images.


SOME TIPS

 • In addition to using the Randomize page of the app, you can use Siri to get random primes. To do so: open Settings > Siri & Search > All Shortcuts > Get random prime, then record the phrase you want to tell Siri whenever you want Siri to get you a random prime.
Note: In order to set up Siri Shortcuts, your device needs to be running iOS 12 or later, and in order to see the 'Get random prime' shortcut available, you must first have generated at least 1 random prime in the app itself.

• If a page is calculating or  images are downloading, switching to a different page will not interrupt that.

• You can tap on the share button to share a result or image with friends, or save it to your phone's files or gallery.

• Tapping on 'Get new images' downloads new images and deletes the already downloaded ones. If you want to keep any of them, save them to your phone's gallery - using the share button - before getting new images.

• You can turn the app's sounds on or off in the app's settings. With the app's sound set to 'On', sounds play when you find a prime number, download new images, or enter invalid text in a textfield.


CHECKER

• Check whether any number is prime, and if it is not, what it is divisible by.

• Type or paste a number, and tap on 'Check'.

• Find a prime number to hear a satisfying 'Choo'!


LIST

• Generate a list with all the prime numbers in a given range: for example, type 1 in the first text box, 10 in the second, tap on List, and you will get 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7.


FACTOR

• Generate a list of the prime factors for any number: for example, type 12, and you will get 2, 3, and 3.


RANDOM

• Generate a random prime of a size of your choice. This can also be done using Siri Shortcuts (see 'Some Tips' above for instructions).


IMAGES

• Get random (clean) images from the internet - all with one thing in common: prime numbers.

- add option for how often to save images to app (1-? seconds)
- hide jump to top/bottom when on top/bottom

- hide keyboard without animation (disrupts loading or other stuff?)
- persistence: last used view(?)
- center random prime result
- [?] avoid user entering an obviously too long/big number to be checked
- OCR: Do images have their number in their Flickr description? https://github.com/garnele007/SwiftOCR
- [? - Must have stop button] add primes orderly generator (maybe with starting point).
- PF: warn about permission denied if image saving fails

- UICollectionView delegates could be put in a separate extension

###### App Store Description
Primes Fun lets you:
• Check whether any* number is prime
• List the prime numbers in any* given range
• Factorize to primes any* given number
• Generate random** prime numbers
• View fun images with prime numbers in them
• Share your results, like that huge prime number you found, which everyone must know about

\*A 64 bit device, like the one in your hand, can calculate up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (or 2^63 − 1)
\*\*Random primes will be generated up to 4,000,000,000 (and some more)

Did you know? When running big calculations, you can navigate in between the app's different pages while they are loading, and come back to them later. Your initiated tasks won't be interrupted.

Get Primes Fun today, and discover the fun!

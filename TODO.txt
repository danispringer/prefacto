What is happening is that at this stage, the tab bar controller doesn't have a selectedViewController yet and you are then casting nil to CheckerViewController resulting in a crash.
To get the CheckerViewController you need, we should access the viewControllers array of the tabBarController and get it from the first position in the array:

let checkerViewController = tabBarController.viewControllers?.first as! CheckerViewController

Problem fixed :blush:

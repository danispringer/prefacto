What is happening is that at this stage, the tab bar controller doesn't have a selectedViewController yet and you are then casting nil to CheckerViewController resulting in a crash.
To get the CheckerViewController you need, we should access the viewControllers array of the tabBarController and get it from the first position in the array:

let checkerViewController = tabBarController.viewControllers?.first as! CheckerViewController

Problem fixed :blush:

SUGGESTION
This could also be an extension of UIViewController. In this way you could access it directly from any view controller just by referring to self
~
UICollectionView delegates could be put in a separate extension of this View Controller to improve the organisation! This is a common practice in swift!
I'll leave you some important documentation from Apple regarding extensions so that you can deepen your knowledge:

What is happening is that at this stage, the tab bar controller doesn't have a selectedViewController yet and you are then casting nil to CheckerViewController resulting in a crash.
To get the CheckerViewController you need, we should access the viewControllers array of the tabBarController and get it from the first position in the array:

let checkerViewController = tabBarController.viewControllers?.first as! CheckerViewController

Problem fixed :blush:

class Alert {
SUGGESTION
This could also be an extension of UIViewController. In this way you could access it directly from any view controller just by referring to self
~
UICollectionView delegates could be put in a separate extension of this View Controller to improve the organisation! This is a common practice in swift!
I'll leave you some important documentation from Apple regarding extensions so that you can deepen your knowledge:

These three bar buttons items could be added in the storyboard to save 3 lines of code

All the strings in this file could be put in a separate struct in order to be organised in the same place

            DispatchQueue.main.async {
SUGGESTION
Instead of dispatching to the main thread in three different blocks of code, we could just wrap the whole closure in a dispatch

These empty lines should be deleted to improve organisation

- Add sound, add sharing option for photo/history stuff, add option to slide to delete rows, add option to empty history, download more photos, improve design, don't add duplicates, add “check another one” and “done” to alert, prime numbers in a row: highscore, show meme, scomponi, show history by recent first
